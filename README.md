Welcome to CombatRacing! Play solo against the computer or with a friend to race
around the track with custom weaponized vehicles. Collect power-ups along the way
to gain an advantage over your opponent in making laps or playing for total destruction!


How to Play:

  At the start menu, select the appropriate button to enter a solo or two player
  race. Use the provided menu tips to change the track or adjust the number of
  laps needed to win the race. Once the track conditions are set, move on to
  vehicle customization. Choose your desired weapon, and once ready you will be
  brought to the track. Use the following controls:

  Controls:

    Player 1:
      W     - Accelerate
      S     - Brake
      G     - Shoot
      F/H   - Rotate Turret
      
    Player 2:
      Up    - Accelerate
      Down  - Brake
      >     - Shoot
      </?   - Rotate Turret
    
  Staying on the road will allow you to maintain faster speed. Power-ups will
  periodically appear on the track, collect them for temporary bonuses.
  Good Luck!
